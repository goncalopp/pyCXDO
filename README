This is a python API for Caixa Geral de Dep√≥sitos - Caixa Directa Online.

Since CGD does not offer a REST API or webservice over its service,
I decided to build it myself. This is done by parsing their website -
an ugly and error-prone method, but the best that can be done as of now.

At the moment, only the most basic functions are implemented.
"test.py" exemplifies some functions.
